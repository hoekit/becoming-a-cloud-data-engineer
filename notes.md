    - <img src="img/notes-credentials.png" alt="" width="60%"/>
    - See: [Current Credentials](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/70c3e8fe-77a0-45d9-a627-fa64f50ddafa)
..


----
### Speech Accuracy
__ Concepts

- Word Error Rate (WER)
    - percentage of incorrect transcriptions in the set
    - lower error rate means higher accuracy

- Ground truth
    - refers to 100% accurate (usually human) transcription to compare
      against to measure accuracy

- Types of error
    - Insertion Errors (I)
        - Words present in transcript but not in ground truth
    - Deletion Errors (D)
        - Words in ground truth but not in transcript
    - Substitution Errors (S)
        - Words present in both but transcribed incorrectly

- WER = (I + D + S) / N
    - Note WER can be > 100% if num errors > num words

- Jaccard Index
    - Measures correctness (broadly speaking)
    - number of words that are the same same over total number of words

- F1 Score
    - Measure precision vs recall
    - Precision almost 1  ⇒  Very few false positives
    - Recall almost 1     ⇒  Very few false negatives
..
__ Practice

- Need 30 mins to 3 hours of audio with ground truth for sampling

- Use the same equipment to get the input as used in transcription

### Terraform
__ What is it:

- Terraform is:
    - a tool for provisioning infrastructure
    - open-source
    - more importantly: declarative
    - automatic changes to infrastructure is easy
    - replicating infrastructure is easy e.g. staging, dev
..
__ Compared to Ansible

- Both
    - Infrastructure as code

- Differences
    - Ansible:
        - Mainly a configuration tool
        - more mature
    - Teraform:
        - Mainly infrastructure tool
        - relatively new
        - more advanced in orchestration
..
__ Terraform Architecture

- Terraform Core
    - Terraform configuration TF-Config i.e. the target state
    - Core creates plan: a function of config and state
        - Plan of what needs to do and the sequence
        - Execute plan with Providers

- Terraform State
    - Is the Current state of the infrastructure

- Providers
    - Connectors to providers:
        - IaaS: AWS | Azure
        - PaaS: Kubernetes
        - SaaS: Fastly
..
__ Terraform commands

- refresh
    - query infrastructure provider to get current State

- plan
    - create an execution plan

- apply
    - execute the plan

- destry
    - destroy the resources/infrastructure

__ Task 2: Create a BQML model

- First create/train a model
- Then run ML.EVALUATE() on the model
- Need to do feature engineering by enriching the data with euclidean distance
..
__   Task 2.1: Create the model with TRANSFORM clause

See: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#transform

### Google Cloud IoT Core
__ What is it

- Cloud IoT Core is:
    - fully managed services
    - securely connect devices via MQTT protocol
        - MQTT: Message Queue Telemetry Transport
    - ingest data from devices
    - manage devices

- Cloud IoT Core works with:
    - Cloud PubSub: by sending data to PubSub
..
__ Concepts:

- Device:
    - a processing unit
    - capable of connecting to the internet and send data
    - send two types of data: telemetry and state

- Telemetry:
    - event data monitored by the device
        - e.g. measurements about the environment
    - `device telemetry event`: refers to telemetry data sent from
      device to cloud

- Device state
    - an arbitrary, user-defined blob of data
    - describes the current status of the device
    - can be structured or unstructured
    - flows only in the device-to-cloud direction

- Device configuration
    - an arbitrary, user-defined blob of data
    - used to control or change a device's state
    - can be structured or unstructured
    - flows only in the cloud-to-device direction

- Device registry
    - A container of devices with shared properties
    - devices are `registered` to a device service like Cloud IoT Core

Device Manager
    - The service used to:
        - monitor device health and activity
        - update device configurations
        - manage credentials and authentication

MQTT:
    - an industry-standard IoT protocol
    - a publish/subscrib messaging protocol

..
__ Cloud IoT Components

- Main components:
    - one device manager
        - to register, monitor and configure devices
    - two protocol bridges (MQTT and HTTP)
        - for devices to connect to Google Cloud
..
__ Reference Architecture

- Device telemetry data sent to Cloud IoT Core
- Events sent to Cloud Pub/Sub

..

__ Lab: https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/1771?parent=catalog
..
__ Cloud IoT Core to PubSub

- A PubSub topic must be created first
- Then create an IoT Core registry

..
__ Device to Cloud IoT Core

- An IoT Core registry must be created first

- A Device must also be registered

- An RS256 public key must be created:
    ```
        openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout rsa_private.pem -nodes \
            -out rsa_cert.pem -subj "/CN=unused"
    ```
- The public key in rsa_cert.pem must be added as a public key in the
  device created
    - Input method: Enter manually
    - Public key format: RS256_X509

- Install Google Cloud root cert
    - `curl -O https://pki.goog/roots.pem`

- A NodeJS sample to simulate a device:
    - git clone https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-iot
    - Needs the private key generated above to work

- Generate events from simulator
    ```
    node cloudiot_mqtt_example_nodejs.js \
        mqttDeviceDemo \
        --projectId=$PROJECT_ID \
        --cloudRegion=us-central1 \
        --registryId=my-registry \
        --deviceId=my-device \
        --privateKeyFile=rsa_private.pem \
        --numMessages=25 \
        --algorithm=RS256 \
        --serverCertFile=roots.pem \
        --mqttBridgePort=443
    ```

### gcloud service accounts
__

- Export env variables
    ```
        export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
    ```

- Create service account e.g. SQL Server to Data Catalog Connector
    ```
        gcloud iam service-accounts create sqlserver2dc-credentials \
          --display-name  "Service Account for SQLServer to Data Catalog connector" \
          --project $PROJECT_ID
    ```

- Create and Download Service Account Key:
    ```
        gcloud iam service-accounts keys create "sqlserver2dc-credentials.json" \
          --iam-account "sqlserver2dc-credentials@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    ```

- Add Data Catalog admin role to Service Account:
    ```
        gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
          --member "serviceAccount:sqlserver2dc-credentials@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
          --quiet \
          --project $PROJECT_ID \
          --role "roles/datacatalog.admin"
    ```

### Readiness Probe
__ What is it

- A readiness probe is a way for Kubernetes to ask your app if if it
  should send traffic to it

- It's where the application and infrastructure meet

- Typically implemented as an endpoint at tcp:81

- See: https://youtu.be/IDoRWieTcMc?t=1527

### Helm
__ What is it

- Helm is:
    - a package manager for Kubernetes
    - packages are called `charts`
    - Helm has a Jenkins Helm chart

..
__ helm commands

- helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
    - Add the stable repo. Like adding a ppa to ubuntu:

- helm repo add jenkins https://charts.jenkins.io
    - Add just the jenkins repo

- helm repo update
    - Update the repo, like `apt-get update`:

- helm install cd stable/jenkins -f jenkins/values.yaml --version 1.2.2 --wait
    - Deploy the chart
    - `jenkins/values.yaml` contains service account credentials to
      access Google Cloud Source Repository
..

__ About jenkins/values.yaml

- Deploys a jenkins pod containing:
    - a jenkins controller
        - a host of plugins are installed
        - these plugins allow Jenkins to connect to the K8S cluster and
          GCP project
    - a jenkins agent
    - a service account
..
__ On completion of the `helm install command` above:

    NAME: cd
    LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Apr  5 12:37:52 2022
    NAMESPACE: default
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 1
    NOTES:

    1. Get your 'admin' user password by running:
      printf $(kubectl get secret --namespace default cd-jenkins -o jsonpath="{.data.jenkins-admin-password}" | base64 --decode);echo

    2. Get the Jenkins URL to visit by running these commands in the same shell:
      NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
            You can watch the status of by running 'kubectl get svc --namespace default -w cd-jenkins'
      export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default cd-jenkins --template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{ . }}{{ end }}")
      echo http://$SERVICE_IP:8080/login

    3. Login with the password from step 1 and the username: admin


    For more information on running Jenkins on Kubernetes, visit:
    https://cloud.google.com/solutions/jenkins-on-container-engine

..
__ gcloud, kubectl and bash commands

export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/component=jenkins-master" -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=cd" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

    - Extract the pod name of the jenkins master pod


kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:8080 >> /dev/null &

    - Setup port mapping of Cloud Shell to pod


kubectl get svc

    - Check Jenkins service is running


printf $(kubectl get secret cd-jenkins -o jsonpath="{.data.jenkins-admin-password}" | base64 --decode);echo

    - View the jenkins admin password
    - Login as `admin` with that password at the mapped port

  # Below is the implementation of Jenkins Configuration as Code.  Add a key under configScripts for each configuration area,
  # where each corresponds to a plugin or section of the UI.  Each key (prior to | character) is just a label, and can be any value.
  # Keys are only used to give the section a meaningful name.  The only restriction is they may only contain RFC 1123 \ DNS label
  # characters: lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.  The keys become the name of a configuration yaml file on the controller in
  # /var/jenkins_home/casc_configs (by default) and will be processed by the Configuration as Code Plugin.  The lines after each |
  # become the content of the configuration yaml file.  The first line after this is a JCasC root element, eg jenkins, credentials,
  # etc.  Best reference is https://<jenkins_url>/configuration-as-code/reference.  The example below creates a welcome message:

__ About the default jenkins/values.yaml file

- It creates:
    - a pod named cd-jenkin-0
    - two services:
        - cd-jenkins at tcp:8080
        - cd-jenkins-agent at tcp:50000

- Need to configure a service account like so:
    - kubectl create clusterrolebinding jenkins-deploy --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=default:cd-jenkins

### Heterogenous Deployments
__

- Common scenarios:
    - Multi-cloud deployments
    - Fronting on-premises data
    - CI/CD processes

- Nice lab on managing canary, blue-green deployments on GKE
    - https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/639?parent=catalog
    - Canary Deployments and rollbacks are made easy
    - Blue-Green Deployments and rollbacks are made easy

### Google Cloud Endpoints
__

- What is it?
    - A set of tools to generate APIs from within an App Engine application

- The steps:
    - git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/endpoints-quickstart.git
    - Create an OpenAPI configuration file
        - See example: openapi.yaml
    - Deploy the API:
        - See example: cd scripts && ./deploy_api.sh

    - Create the app
        - See example: app/airports.py
    - Deploy the app:
        - See example: cd scripts && ./deploy_app.sh

    - See also other scripts in the `scripts` directory

- If Google Cloud Endpoints is used with App Engine
    - Updating the endpoints will also need to redeploy the app

- The nice thing is that Google Cloud Endpoints provides rate-limiting
..

### Google Actions
__

- Actions on Google Developer Console
    - http://console.actions.google.com/

- Actions Glossary
    - https://developers.google.com/actions/glossary

- Glossary:
    - `Action`: an interaction built for Google Assistant that performs
      specific tasks based on user input.
    - `Intent`: the goal of the Action (e.g. generate quotes). An intent
      takes user input and channels it to trigger an event.
    - `Agent (Dialogflow)`: a module that uses NLU and ML to transform
      user input into actionable data to be used by an Assistant
      application.

- So basically the flow is this:
    - Google Assistant receives some input e.g. user speech or some text
    - That's passed on to DialogFlow parses it and matches it to an intent
        - It then triggers an intent
        - An intent is like an endpoint within an Android app

### Google Cloud Source Repositories
__ What is it

- Provide a managed Git version control remote
..
__ gcloud commands

- Create a a repo in Google Cloud Source Repositories
    - gcloud source repos create REPO_DEMO

- Clone Cloud repo to local
    - gcloud source repos clone REPO_DEMO

- Configure git
    - git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    - git config --global user.name "Your Name"

- The usual git commands:
    - git push origin master
..
__ Integration with Kubernetes

- Create a Kubernetes cluster that has access to Cloud Source
  Repositories and Google Container Registry
    - The `--scopes` argument lets the cluster access Google Cloud Repo
      and Google Container Registry
    ```
        gcloud container clusters create jenkins-cd \
        --num-nodes 2 \
        --machine-type n1-standard-2 \
        --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/projecthosting,cloud-platform"
    ```

### Kubernetes
__ Kubernetes pods

- A Docker container is:
    - typically for a single microservice
    - a microservice typically talks to other microservices

- A Kubernetes pod is:
    - a group of containers tied together
    - with shared storage and network resources
        - shared namespace
        - One IP per pod
    - to simplify admin and networking
    - also have volumes

- A Pod Volume is
    - a set of data disks that live as long as the pods live
    - can be used by containers in that pod
    - shared by containers in the pod
..
__ Kubernetes Services

- A Kubernetes service:
    - provides stable endpoints for pods
        - Pods can be restarted anytime, resulting in changed IP
    - uses labels to determine what Pods to operate on
        - if they have the corect labels, they are exposed

- Types of Service:
    - ClusterIP (default):
        - means service only visible inside K8s cluster
    - LoadBalancer:

__ Notes from Kubernetes for Sysadmins, 2016

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlAXp0-M6SY

- Kubernetes is declarative
    - A contract between developer and sysadmin
    - Kubernetes expects a container
        - Like Fedex expects a Fedex box

- Think of containers in two parts
    - Building the container
    - Running the container

- Configuration for apps:
    - Handled by Secrets and ConfigMaps
        - kubectl create secret generic ngins --from-file nginx.conf

- The problem with containers @20:10
    - Most people are not used to explicitly listing the filepaths that
      the app need

### Docker
__ What is Docker, what's in it, how it helps:

- Docker is for:
    - separating application from infrastructure

- Docker combines:
    - kernel containerization features
    - workflows and
    - tooling

- Docker helps with:
    - testing
    - deployment
    - shorten time between writing code and running code

- Docker works with:
    - Kubernetes
..
__ Naming in Docker:

- Naming:
    - `Container ID` is a UUID generated by Docker e.g. 73bc1674ee1b
    - `Container Name` is human-readable string e.g. epic_ishizaka
    - `Image` is the docker image e.g. hello-world
    - `Command` is the image command to execute e.g. /hello or bash
..
__ Build a Docker image using a Dockerfile

- Sample dockerfile
    ```
        # Use an official Node runtime as the parent image
        FROM node:6

        # Set the working directory in the container to /app
        WORKDIR /app

        # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
        ADD . /app

        # Make the container's port 80 available to the outside world
        EXPOSE 80

        # Run app.js using node when the container launches
        CMD ["node", "app.js"]
    ```

- Notes:
    - All different apps such as NodeJS, etc may have parent Docker Images
        - This simplifies development
    - The /app dir must already exist in the NodeJS image
    - Keywords:
        - FROM, WORKDIR, ADD, EXPOSE, CMD
    - [Dockerfile command reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

- Sample app.js file
    ```
        const http = require('http');
        const hostname = '0.0.0.0';
        const port = 80;
        const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
            res.statusCode = 200;
              res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
                res.end('Hello World\n');
        });
        server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
            console.log('Server running at http://%s:%s/', hostname, port);
        });
        process.on('SIGINT', function() {
            console.log('Caught interrupt signal and will exit');
            process.exit();
        });
    ```

- Command to build the image (takes under a minute):
    - `docker build -t node-app:0.1 .
        - `-t`: names and tags an image with the name:tag syntax e.g.
          name is `node-app` and tag is `0.1`
    - Creates two docker images:
        - `node` which is the parent image
        - `node-app` which is based on `node
    - Both images are at about 884MB

- List of official node versions
    - https://hub.docker.com/_/node
..
__ Running and stopping a Docker image with port mapping

- Command:
    - `docker run -p 4000:80 --name my-app node-app:0.1`
        - `-p 4000:80` maps local port 4000 to container port 80
        - `--name my-app` specifies the container name
    - `docker run -d ...`
        - `-d` will run in background as daemon
    - `docker stop NAME`
        - stops a running container
    - `docker rm NAME`
        - removes execution history from `docker ps -a` output
..
__ Viewing and tailing outputs:

- Command:
    - `docker logs CONTAINER_ID`
        - tail the STDOUT of CMD
        - For CONTAINER_ID, just type enough to disambiguate the
          different container IDs
    - `docker logs -f CONTAINER_ID`
        - tail -f the STDOUT of CMD
..
__ Debugging containers

- Start an interactive Bash session inside a running container:
    - `docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash`
        - `-it` allows interaction with container
            - does this by allocating a pseudo-tty and keeping stdin open
        - bash will run in WORKDIR specified in the Dockerfile

- Inspect container metadata
    - `docker inspect CONTAINER_ID`
    - `docker inspect --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' CONTAINER_ID`
        - Inspect specific fields
..
__ Publishing to Google Container Registry

- Naming images:
    - hostname for Google Container Registry (gcr) is `gcr.io`
    - project-id is the GCP Project-ID e.g. qwiklabs-gcp-00-98d3951b3b64
    - image is the image name e.g. node-app
    - tag is string of choice e.g. 0.1. Default to "latest" if unspecified

- Tag an image:
    - `docker tag node-app:0.2 gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/node-app:0.2`
        - `tag` creates a tag, something like an alias

- Publish to GCR
    - `docker push gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/node-app:0.2`
        - Note that the full name is specified
        - Apparently the target is something like a git repo?
..
__ Clean up Docker environment

- Stop and remove all containers
    - `docker stop $(docker ps -q)`
    - `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)`

- Remove all images
    - `docker rmi node-app:0.2 gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/node-app node-app:0.1`
    - `docker rmi node:6`
    - `docker rmi $(docker images -aq) # remove remaining images`
    - `docker images`
..
__ Pull an image from gcr.io

- Pull an image:
    - `docker pull gcr.io/[project-id]/node-app:0.2`
        - fetch image from gcr.io
    - `docker run -p 4000:80 -d gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/node-app:0.2`
        - run image in background
    - `curl http://localhost:4000`
        - Check output
..

### Google Apps Script
__

- Server-side JS similar to Node.js, focused on tight integration with
  Workspace and other Google services
- To automate work across Google products and third party services
..


----
### Experimenting with Big Datasets
__

- To generate streaming data, one way is to simulate it. [github](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/courses/streaming/publish/send_sensor_data.py)
    - The notion of speedup factor in the code is interesting

- Sources of public datasets:
    - UCI ML Repository
        - Online Retail Data Set [uci](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)

- GCP:
    - data-to-insights ecommerce dataset [gcp](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=data-to-insights&page=ecommerce)

### On Managing Change
__ Intro

- The notion that everything that we are doing is some form or other of
  managing and coping with change
    - This section of the notes try to note the changes and point to
      solutions
..
__ From Batch to Stream Processing

- The truth is business have always wanted stream processing however the
  computing technologies of the past have only been capable of batch
  processing.

..
__ From Flat Workloads to Seasonal Workloads

- Retailers, Movie industries have seasonal workloads
- Food on the other hand has rather flat workload
..


----
### Google Pub/Sub
__

- Pub/Sub
    - 100s of miliseconds latency
    - API: C#, Go, Java, Node, Python, Ruby
    - Save messages for 7 days
    - HIPAA compliance
    - Encrypted in-motion and at-rest
    - At least once semantics
    - Publisher: Pub/Sub Client that creates a Topic
        - Multiple, decoupled Publishers to the same topic
    - Subscriber: Pub/Sub Client that creates a Subscription (to a Topic)
        - A Subscription is only to a single topic
        - Muliple, decoupled Subscriptions to the same topic
    - Pub/Sub is essentially a decoupled enterprise message bus at scale
    - Pull subscriptions for manual pulls by any in a pool of workers
        - This is an interesting pattern

- Subscription
    - Can setup Filters on message attributes

- Patterns:
    - Pass-through:
        - 1 Publisher  -> 1 Topic -> 1 Subscription -> 1 Subscriber
    - Fan-in:
        - N Publishers -> 1 Topic -> 1 Subscription -> M Subscribers
        - All Publisher messages goes to the same Subscription
        - Each subscriber can filter on messages of interest
    - Fan-out:
        - 1 Publisher  -> 1 Topic -> 1 Subscription -> M Subscribers
            - All subscribers get all messages from Publisher
            - i.e. replicate publisher messages to all subscribers

- Push vs Pull deliveries
    - Pull Subscribers must send ACK after getting the Msg
    - Push Subscribers assumed to send ACK on a HTTP 200 OK status
        - Push Subscribers are web-hooks

- Message Replays
    - Allows Pub/Sub to send older messages to new subscribers

- Subcriber Worker Pools
    - Only one worker needs to send an ACK
    - A good pattern for autoscaling workers

- Messages
    - Limit: 10 MB
    - Can send binary data
    - Message attributes are stored separately as metadata to facilliate
      filtering to avoid deserializing

- Publishing
    - Send messages in batches
    - Pub/Sub waits till batch is full
    - Even with batch publishing, it is delivered one at a time to
      subscribers

- Subscribing
    - Message ordering supported if in the same region
    - Configured when creating a Subscription
    - Prevents Denial-of-Service on the push subscriber

- Subscription Delivery
    - Data is held/buffered until application is ready
    - Delivery failures should end-up in a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
    - Exponential Backoff implemented for delivery failures for better
      flow control
    - Data may be delivered out-of-order (not a queue)
    - Duplication will happen
    - Dataflow will dedup messages and also handle late data to mitigate
      out-of-order messages

----
### Stream Processing
__

- Google Reference Architecture
    - Ingestion: Pub/Sub
    - Stream Processing:
        - Dataflow
            - (ELT|ETL: mostly aggregates & transforms)
            - Also enrichment
    - Storage: BigQuery, Cloud Bigtable
    - Analytics & Visualization: BigQuery

- Unbounded data
    - Characteristics:
        - Infinite dataset
        - Time of data element matters
        - Typically in-motion / held in temporaty storage
    - Contrast with bounded data:
        - Finite dataset
        - Time element usually disregarded
        - Typically at-rest / persisted in durable storage

- Stream Processing Systems
    - Low Latency
    - Speculative results
    - Controls for correctness
..
__ Use Cases

- Online/Real-time decisions (100 ms - 10 s)
    - Real-time recommendations
    - Fraud detection
    - Stock trading
    - ML applications

- Data Integration (10 sec - 10 min)
    - Real-time Data Warehouse Dashboards
    - ML applications:
        - Sentiment analysis
..
__ Challenge: Volume

- The challenge here is that the size of data has increased

- Google proposes autoscaling as a solution here
    - I think that's only if the data increase is seasonal or unpredictable
    - Pub/Sub can autoscale to handle changing volumes of data

..
__ Challenge: Velocity

- The challenge here is that time between each data element is shorter
    - Or more data elements in the same time span
    - Think of Black Friday or online sales days

- Google proposes streaming processing here
    - to handle variability of data arrivals
    - Dataflow handles streaming data
..
__ Challenge: Variety

- Voice data and images is one form of unstructured data

- Google proposes using AI to handle unstructured data

..
__ Solution Architectures

- Google Cloud Platform Solution
    - <img src="img/stream-processing-gcp-solution.png" alt="" width="80%"/>
..
__ Challenge: Late arriving data

- The challenge here is that data could arrive out of order
    - Google Pub/Sub does not guarantee ordering across regions
..
__ Windows in Stream Processing

- Motivation:
    - Aggregation functions typically occurs over a finite window
    - Streams are unbounded
    - Streams are divided into a series of finite windows
        - Think modulus, or the second hand of the clod
        - Making the infinite, finite

- Terms & Abbreviations:
    - DTS: Datetime Stamp

..


----
### Google Dataflow
__

- Dataflow for stream processing
    - Dedups by:
        - Maintaining a list of unique ids seen in the last 10 minutes
    - Supports streaming windows by:
        - Automatically windowing on date-time-stamp (DTS)
        - If there is a significant delay between the timestamp of an
          event and the time the message is actually received, able to
          use a PTransform to update the DTS in the message's metadata
          (which is used for windowing) to use the original event
          timestamp

..
__ Types of Windows

- 

..
__ Watermarks

- The watermark
- A nice talk on streaming processing, watermarks, 2016 [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWxSLmkWPm4)
    - Motivates the need for stream processing and windows
    - Introduces the notion of low watermarks
    - Benefits of watermarks:
        - Visibility: Knows how much backlog there is
        - Actionability: Once passed the watermark, window is bounded,
          aggregates flushed
    - Formalizes notion of watermarks in a DAG pipeline
    - Inferring Source (PubSub) watermarks from metadata
    - Notion of data watermarks vs system watermarks
    - System watermarks to distinguish between data and system delays
    - Source matermarks are critical
..
__ Custom triggers

- Dataflow triggers window flush in several ways
    - AfterWatermark (Default)
        - Trigger after watermark
    - AfterProcessing
        - Trigger after processing for some time duration
    - AfterCount
        - Trigger after processing N elements

- Can be combined e.g.
    - While batching, trigger several releases using `AfterProcessing`
    - Then on watermark, trigger using `AfterWatermark`
    - And finally, trigger using `AfterCount` for late arriving elements
..

### Dimensions of a Solution
__

- Scalability
    - How does the solution handle larger input volumes

- Fault Tolerance
    - How does the solution handle component failures

- Latency
    - How long does it take the solution to convert input into output
..


----
### Change Data Capture
__

- Change data capture (CDC) provides historical change information for a
  user table by capturing both the fact that Data Manipulation Language
  (DML) changes (insert / update / delete) were made and the changed
  data. Changes are captured in real time by using a capture process
  that reads changes from the transaction log and places them in
  corresponding change tables. These change tables provide a historical
  view of the changes made over time to source tables. CDC functions
  enable the change data to be consumed easily and systematically.
    - From [microsoft](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sql-blog/stream-data-changes-from-a-cdc-enabled-azure-sql-database-to-an/ba-p/2570907)

- Me: It's making the database transaction log accessible to other
  processes.

### Kubernetes
__

- Kubernetes
    - For deploying containerized applications
    - Runs on a cluster composed of a master node and worker nodes

- Kubernetes Deployment object
    - An object for deploying stateless applications like web servers

- Kubernetes Service object
    - Defined rules and load balancing for accessing applications from
      the internet
    - No Service means no access from internet
..


----
### Security Credentials
__

- How security credentials typically designed:
    - First, there are credentials, usually made up of a username and
      password
    - Credentials represent an identity
    - An identity may have one or more roles
    - These roles have access permissions
..


----
### Cloud Resources
__

- Naming
    - Use the format `team-resource` e.g. an instance `jupiter-webserver1`

- Compute sizes:
    - f1-micro for small Linux VMS
    - n1-standard-1 for Windows or other applications, such as Kubernetes nodes

..


----
### ETL Design Patterns
__

- Ingest data:
    - On success, move source data to "Archive"
    - On error, flag error, move source data to "Archive"

- Rolling Windows:
    - Make data windows an input parameter
    - Start and end date of the rolling window can be derived from
      job schedule date. Run dates are not suitable because re-runs will
      then not be idempotent.

- Workflow Scheduling
    - Also known as triggering jobs
    - It could be periodic (Pull)
        - This is named Pull cos periodically look into a folder then "Pull"
    - It could be event-driven (Push): e.g. triggered by new file in a folder
        - This is Push because file if Pushed to folder and that triggers

- Airflow [web](https://airflow.apache.org/)

- Executes tasks on an array of workers e.g.
    - Google Kubernetes engine workers

- DAG [web](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/dags.html)
    - A Directed Acyclic Graph is a collection of all the tasks you want
      to run, organized in a way that reflects their relationships and
      dependencies.

- Operator [web](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/operators.html)
    - The description of a single task, it is usually atomic. For
      example, the BashOperator is used to execute bash command.

- Task [web](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/tasks.html)
    - A parameterised instance of an Operator; a node in the DAG.

- Task Instance [web](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/tasks.html#task-instances)
    - A specific run of a task; characterized as: a DAG, a Task, and a
      point in time. It has an indicative state: running, success,
      failed, skipped, ...

- More concepts [web](https://airflow.apache.org/concepts.html#)

- Relies on 'Operators' to invoke services
    - See: https://airflow.apache.org/integration.html

- Airflow workflows are written in Python using 'Operators'
    - Parameterization can be done using macros

- Airflow visually represents the workflow in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

- Allows multi-cloud integration
    - Unlikely in practice due to egress charges

- Why AirFlow?
    - Visualization of workflow?
    - Visualization has job-completion-status indicators: Green|Pink|Red|etc
    - A simple dashboard of success|failed jobs
        - How to specify window?
    - Easily access logs of failed steps

- Support triggers via POST requests

- Auto retry N times supported

    - Full compatibility with Apache Airflow
    - Practices
        - Have tasks retry
        - Tasks should be idempotent else retry may not work
        - All work should be in Tasks
        - Use existing operators first
        - Modules: Use PyPi and Composer allows specifying packages
        - Use DAG Run Operator to compose Tasks instead of SubDags

__ Naming

- Maven projects are named using Maven UIDs:
    - groupID e.g. com.firexis.com
    - artifactID e.g. someApp
    - version e.g. 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
..
__

- What is Maven:
    - A build tool that helps in project management
        - Generate source code
        - Generates docs
        - Compiles source code
        - Downloads libraries
        - Packages compiled codes into JAR files
        - Installing packaged code in local repo or central repo
    - Based on Project Object Model (POM)
        - An XML file that contains info regarding project and configuration
          details
        - Essential file is pom.xml
    - Used to build and manage Java-based project. Simplifies daya to
      day work of Java developers

- Maven solves the following problems:
    - Ensure needed JAR files are available
    - Downloads dependencies from mvnrepository.com
    - Creates the right project structure
    - Builds and deploys the project

- Understanding pom.xml

    - A Project is defined uniquely by:
        - groupID
        - artifactID
        - version
    - Maven UIDs = groupID + artifactID + version
    - Depencies are also refered to via Maven UIDs
    - project
        - The root element in pom.xml
    - parent
        - to inherit from another pom.xml file
    - dependencies
        - container for dependency
    - dependency
        - a Maven UID that the current project depends on
    - build.plugins
        - container for plugins
    - build.plugins.plugin
        - A Maven UID of plugins needed during the build process

- Understanding Maven Archetypes

### Compare and contrast technologies
__

- Apache Spark vs Apache Beam
    - allegro.tech experience report, 2021 [web](https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/06/1-task-2-solutions-spark-or-beam.html)
        - A good write-up
        - Conclusion: Dataflow is more expensive, Dataproc is cheaper.
          So, essentially trading Dataflow cost for developer cost
    - A blog article circa 2016 [web](https://mpouttuclarke.wordpress.com/2016/02/06/apache-beam-vs-apache-spark-comparison/)
    - An SO question circa May 2017 [so](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43581127)
..

----
### Notion of Component Gateway
__

- In Google Cloud Dataproc, there is the notion of a `Component
  Gateway`. It allows tools commonly associated with Apache Spark to be
  connected to the cluster.
- This is interesting in the sense that the backend setup and
  configuration is automated.

### Serverless vs Managed Service
__

- Managed Service
    - Means: No setup, no management e.g. backup, replication, scaling
    - Examples:
        - DataProc

- Serverless
    - Means: Managed-Service + Event-driven/API endpoints
    - Examples:
        - BigQuery
        - DataFlow
        - Pub/Sub
        - Cloud Storage
..

----
### On Pseudo Benefits
__

- Pseudo benefits are things that sound like benefits but may not be.
    - An example is the availability of many choices to do something
    - Choices introduces complexity and the need to manage that
      complexity
    - If one selects the simplest option in a bevy of choices and simply
      stick to that, then it may help simplify the entire architecture

- In contrast, the ability to auto-scale is a true benefit
    - But only if you have lots of compute/storage and don't know what
      to do with them
..

----
### On Data Lineage
__

- In a recent development project, one of the things I find nice-to-have
  is the ability to know the call dependency graph.
    - A call stack is the list of function calls leading to the current
      function call. A call dependency graph would be a DAG going
      backwards from the current function to all the functions that can
      possibly call this function.
    - Why is this useful? When there is a problem with a function, the
      function will get modified as part of the fix. Knowing the
      dependency graph is useful because I'll know who will may get
      impacted upstream.
    - Another use of the call dependency graph is to work backwards to
      find impacted services and only restart those services to use the
      updated version of the function.

- How is that related to data lineage?
    - It's analogous. When there is a problem with data downstream. I'd
      like to be able to trace back to how that problem data was
      processed upstream.

__ Case Studies

- You are building data pipelines. Some steps require call an API such
  as the Translate APi to augment/transform data. Another part of the
  pipeline requires processing more suited for procedural programming.
  What do you do:
    - Since the transformations cannot be expressed in SQL or are too
      complex to do in SQL, these transformations should be done in an
      ETL fashion.
    - Build an ETL pipeline
    - Implement the transforms in Dataflow, Dataproc, or use Data Fusion
      GUI to build pipelines

- There are some gaps in historical data. What are you going to do?
    - Discuss with the business users
    - Backfill with augmented data with the same distribution generated
      from the previous three years of data

- Need to batch load historical data. Data is clean and correct:
    - Since data is clean and correct, no further transformation needed
    - Use EL data pipeline
        - File hits Cloud Storage
        - Cloud Function invokes BigQuery load
        - Table appended to
    - To expose loaded file for use:
        - Table stored in private dataset
        - Public view that performs integrity checks
        - SQL query transforms and creates destination public table

- You create an image service. Users upload lots of images. The Vision
  API is used to identify objects in the image. How would you store this
  data for unknown future analysis?
    - The Vision API returns JSON data.
    - Since future use cases is unknown, the raw JSON data and a pointer
      to the original image should be stored.
    - This is an ELT pipeline
    - EL the image and JSON
    - Later, transforms may be applied to query the JSON to extract
      required data

- Task 1: Prepare the training data
    - Navigation menu > Vertex AI
    - Create dataset name: LoanRisk
    - Upload data options:
        - Upload a local file from your computer.
        - Select files from Cloud Storage.
        - Select data from BigQuery.
    - Import from Cloud Storage:
        - spls/cbl455/loan_risk.csv
    - Generate statistics
        - To see statistics of loans data
            - Total rows: 2,050
            - Age: 2048 distinct values
            - ClientID: 2,050 distinct values
            - Default: 2 distinct values
            - Income: 2050 distinct values
            - Loan: 2050 distinct values

- Task 2: Train your model
    - Strangely, the dataset name expected is "LoanRisk"
    - Set Objective = Classification
    - Model Details:
        - Model name: LoanRisk
        - Target column: Default
        - Advanced Model Options:
            - To determine training vs testing data & setup encryption
    - Training options
        - Specify columns (features) to include in training model
        - Exclude: ClientID
        - Advanced Training Options:
            - Can select different optimization objectives
            - See: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/tabular-opt-obj
    - Compute & Pricing
        - Set Budget: 1 (node hours)
            - 1 compute hour is a good start
        - Early Stopping: Enabled
        - Click: Start training

- Task 3: Evaluate the model performance (demo only)
    - This task is demo-only, no real hands-on cos the training takes an hour
    - On [ROC Curve and AUC](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc)
    - Navigate > Vertex AI > Models
    - Click on model trained > Evaluate
    - Possible to manually adjust the confidence threshold
        - <img src="img/notes-confidence-threshold.png" alt="" width="80%"/>
        - In image above, looking at the Precision-recall by threhold
          graph on the right, I'd raise the threshold to about 0.72
          because higher values result in lower recall. But the actual
          change will depend on the business case

- Task 4: Deploy the model (demo only)
    - This task is demo-only, no real hands-on cos the training takes an hour
    - Create and define an endpoint
        - Navigate to model page > Deploy and test
        - Click: Deploy to endpoint
        - Endpoint name: LoanRisk

### Confusion Matrix, Recall and Precision
__

- Confusion Matrix defines the following:
    - True Positive   TP   Predicted 🐈 Cat / Turned out to be 🐈 Cat   ✔️
    - True Negative   TN   Predicted 🐕 Dog / Turned out to be 🐕 Dog   ✔️
    - False Positive  FP   Predicted 🐈 Cat / Turned out to be 🐕 Dog   ❌
    - False Negative  FP   Predicted 🐕 Dog / Turned out to be 🐈 Cat   ❌

- Helps to think of the confusion matrix as follows:
    - Predictions come first, the actual values come later and compared
      to prediction
    - We are typically interested in Positive predictions
    - Hence the Recall and Precision are useful metrics
    - Negative predictions can easily be turned into positive
      predictions

- Recall almost 1     ⇒  Very few false negatives
    - Missed some which were actually positive, hence imperfect recall
    - Like having to recall a list of 16 items, and of the 16 items
      remembered, some were not in the original list. Imperfect recall.
    - TP / (TP + FN)
    - Question: Did you get all of them right?

- Precision almost 1  ⇒  Very few false positives
    - Lots of positive predictions but some turned out to be false
    - Like shooting at real and fake ducks, some ducks turned out to be
      fake, hence imperfect precision
    - TP / (TP + FP)
    - Of all the ones you shot, how many were what you aimed for?

### First Class Objects
__

- Google Feature Store
    - The Feature Store in Vertex AI has the result of making features
      [first class
      objects](https://www.cs.iusb.edu/~danav/teach/c311/c311_2_firstclass.html)
      in AI. This is just fancy speak for making features the priority.
    - And making it a priority means make it easy to work with, to
      organize, to store, to aggregate, to share, to reuse, etc.
    - This leads to the interesting question:
        - What are the priority objects in different stages of the Data
          Engineering workflow?

- Data Warehouses
    - The first class objects in Data Warehouses should to be schema?
    - Schema should be easy to work with, to organize, to manage
    - Schema should be fluid, composable and all the nice buzzwords
    - Maybe..

- Tasks:
    - Task 1: Set the default region and zone for all resources
    - Task 2: Create multiple web server instances
    - Task 3: Configure the load balancing service
    - Task 4: Sending traffic to your instances
    - Task 5: Create an HTTP load balancer
    - Task 6: Testing traffic sent to your instances

- Notes:
    - The gcloud create instance is quite powerful, allowing arbitrary
      startup scripts e.g. installing apache and customizing the default

    - `gcloud compute ... create` commands:
        - addresses: Static, public IP address
        - http-health-checks: Health check resource (Legacy)
        - target-pools: Targets for IP Forwarding
        - forwarding-rules: IP Forwarding rule

        - instance-groups managed: Managed instance groups
        - health-checks: Health check resource
        - backend-services: A grouping of instances like target pools
        - url-maps: URL rules to map requests to backend services. This
          is a load balancer!
        - target-http-proxies: HTTP proxy to route requests to url map
    - The step in Task 3 differs from Task 5:
        - Task 3: Load balancing results from using a combination of
          forwarding rules and target pool
        - Task 5: Load balancing results from grouping the instances in
          a `backend service`
        - The target-pool + forwarding-rule in Task 3 maps to
          backend-service + url-map + target-http-proxy in Task 5. One
          more level of indirection
    - Task 5 takes awhile to come up to wait a bit before clicking on
      the `Check my progress` button

### Lab: [Kubernetes Engine: Qwik Start](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/878?parent=catalog)
__

Sat, 19 Mar 2022

- Tasks
    - Task 1: Set a default compute zone
    - Task 2: Create a GKE cluster
    - Task 3: Get authentication credentials for the cluster

- Notes:
    - Creating and deleting the cluster takes awhile so best to read
      through the lab in its entirety before starting the lab
    - [`Manage Containerized Apps with Kubernetes Engine`](https://youtu.be/u9nsngvmMK4)

- Task 1: Set a default compute zone
    ```
    # Set default zone
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a
    ```

- Task 2: Create a GKE cluster
    - A cluster has a cluster master and several workers called nodes
    - Note: Cluster names must start with a letter and end with an
      alphanumeric, and cannot be longer than 40 characters.
    ```
    # Create a cluster
    # gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER-NAME]
    gcloud container clusters create my-cluster
    ```

- Task 3: Get authentication credentials for the cluster
    - Auth credentials needed to interact with cluster
    ```
    # Get cluster credentials
    # gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER-NAME]
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster
    ```

- Task 4: Deploy an application to the cluster
    - Lab deploys a hello-app
    - `Deployment` objects are for stateless applications like web servers
    - `Service` objects define rules and load balancing for accessing
      app from the net
    ```
    # Create a new Deployment of 'hello-server' from a pre-defined container image
    kubectl create deployment hello-server --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
    # Expect: deployment.apps/hello-server created

    # Create a Service, which exposes app to external traffic
    kubectl expose deployment hello-server --type=LoadBalancer --port 8080
    # Expect: service/hello-server exposed

    # Inspect service:
    kubectl get service
    # Expect: NAME  TYPE    CLUSTER-IP  EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)    AGE
    ```

- Task 5: Deleting the cluster
    ```
    # gcloud container clusters delete [CLUSTER-NAME]
    gcloud container clusters delete my-cluster

### Lab: [Create a Virtual Machine](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/3563?parent=catalog)
__

Sat, 19 Mar 2022

- Tasks
    - Create a virtual machine with the Cloud Console.
    - Create a virtual machine with the gcloud command line.
    - Deploy a web server and connect it to a virtual machine.

- `gcloud`:
    ```
    # List active account name
    gcloud auth list

    # List project ID
    gcloud config list project
    ```

- Typical VM parameters:
    - <img src="img/notes-typical-vm-parameters.png" alt="" width="80%"/>

- Install NGINX web server on a fresh VM
    ```
    sudo su -
    apt-get update
    apt-get install nginx -y

    # Check that nginx is running
    ps auwx | grep nginx
    ```

- Create a VM via cloud shell:
    ```
    gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone us-central1-f

    # Get help on CLI
    gcloud compute instances create --help

    # Set default zone and region
    gcloud config set compute/zone ...
    gcloud config set compute/region ...

    # SSH connect
    gcloud compute ssh gcelab2 --zone us-central1-f
    ```
..

### Lab: [Getting Started with Cloud Shell and gcloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/563?parent=catalog)
__

Sat, 19 Mar 2022

- Task 1: Configure your environment
    ```
    # See default region and zone
    gcloud config get-value compute/zone
    gcloud config get-value compute/region

    # Describe project
    # gcloud compute project-info describe --project <your_project_ID>
    gcloud compute project-info describe --project qwiklabs-gcp-02-b02d242a3d87

    # Set environment variables:
    # export PROJECT_ID=<your_project_ID>
    export PROJECT_ID=qwiklabs-gcp-02-b02d242a3d87

    # export ZONE=<your_zone>
    export ZONE=us-central1-a

    # Create a VM
    gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone $ZONE

    - gcloud compute allows you to manage your Compute Engine resources in a format that's simpler than the Compute Engine API.
    - instances create creates a new instance.
    - gcelab2 is the name of the VM.
    - The --machine-type flag specifies the machine type as n1-standard-2.
    - The --zone flag specifies where the VM is created.

    If you omit the --zone flag, the gcloud tool can infer your desired zone based on your default properties. Other required instance settings, such as machine type and image, are set to default values if not specified in the create command.

    # To get help
    gcloud compute instances create --help

    # gcloud help
    gcloud -h
    gcloud config --help

    # List gcloud config
    gcloud config list                  # common user config
    gcloud config list --all            # all config

    # List gcloud components
    gcloud components list
    ```

- Task 2: Install a new component
    ```
    # Install beta components:
    sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk

    # Enable gcloud interactive mode:
    gcloud beta interactive

    ```

- Task 3: Connect to VM via SSH
    ```
    gcloud compute ssh gcelab2 --zone $ZONE

    ```

### Apache Beam and Google DataFlow
__

- How are they related?

- Apache Beam is the program, DataFlow is the engine

- If they were database technologies, Apache Beam would be SQL programs
  and DataFlow would be the database engine running those SQL programs

- There other pipeline runners other than Google DataFlow. But the key
  feature of DataFlow is autoscaling

- See also: https://medium.com/swlh/dataflow-and-apache-beam-the-result-of-a-learning-process-since-mapreduce-c591b2ab180e (TODO)
- Apache Beam video analytics for Football games (28:57m)
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPuE30kY6-c
    - Design and create a platform that can handle auto-production and
      broadcasting, for up to hundreds of games per weekend with as
      little time delay as possible

    - 5GB persistence home directory on Google Cloud
    - In Cloud Console, click on `Activate Cloud Shell` button
    - <img src="img/GSP001_1-cloud-shell.png" alt="" width="80%"/>

- `gcloud`:
    - Docs: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud
    ```
    List active account names
        gcloud auth list

    List project ID
        gcloud config list project
    ```

- Regions and zones
    - One region has many zones
    - Naming convention: REGION-ZONE
        - Region: us-west1, Zone: a  -->  us-west1-a
        - Region: us-west1, Zone: b  -->  us-west1-b
        - Region: asia-east1, Zone: a  -->  asia-east1-a
        - etc
    - Zones are like data centers (I think)
    - Resources such as VM, Storage, etc live in zones aka data centers
