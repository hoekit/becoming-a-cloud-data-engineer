### Lab: Vertex AI: Predicting Loan Risk with AutoML
__

Sun, 20 Mar 2022 (2h30m / 5 Credits)
- Course: [Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/3)

- Goals:
    - Use AutoML to build a machine learning model to predict loan risk
    - 2,050 data points from financial institution
    - AutoML requires minimum 1,000 data points

- Tasks:
    - Task 1: Prepare the training data
    - Task 2: Train your model
    - Task 3: Evaluate the model performance 
    - Task 4: Deploy the model
    - Task 5: Shared Machine Learning (SML) Bearer Token
    - Task 6: Get predictions

- Notes:
    - [Vertex Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing?_ga=2.181173863.-1790764198.1647754986)
    - [Vertex AI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-unified/docs)
    - [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc)

- Task 1: Prepare the training data
    - Navigation menu > Vertex AI
    - Create dataset name: LoanRisk
    - Upload data options:
        - Upload a local file from your computer.
        - Select files from Cloud Storage.
        - Select data from BigQuery.
    - Import from Cloud Storage:
        - spls/cbl455/loan_risk.csv
    - Generate statistics
        - To see statistics of loans data
            - Total rows: 2,050
            - Age: 2048 distinct values
            - ClientID: 2,050 distinct values
            - Default: 2 distinct values
            - Income: 2050 distinct values
            - Loan: 2050 distinct values

- Task 2: Train your model
    - Strangely, the dataset name expected is "LoanRisk"
    - Set Objective = Classification
    - Model Details:
        - Model name: LoanRisk
        - Target column: Default
        - Advanced Model Options:
            - To determine training vs testing data & setup encryption
    - Training options
        - Specify columns (features) to include in training model
        - Exclude: ClientID
        - Advanced Training Options:
            - Can select different optimization objectives
            - See: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/training/tabular-opt-obj
    - Compute & Pricing
        - Set Budget: 1 (node hours)
            - 1 compute hour is a good start
        - Early Stopping: Enabled
        - Click: Start training

- Task 3: Evaluate the model performance (demo only)
    - This task is demo-only, no real hands-on cos the training takes an hour
    - On [ROC Curve and AUC](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc)
    - Navigate > Vertex AI > Models
    - Click on model trained > Evaluate
    - Possible to manually adjust the confidence threshold
        - <img src="img/notes-confidence-threshold.png" alt="" width="80%"/>
        - In image above, looking at the Precision-recall by threhold
          graph on the right, I'd raise the threshold to about 0.72
          because higher values result in lower recall. But the actual
          change will depend on the business case

- Task 4: Deploy the model (demo only)
    - This task is demo-only, no real hands-on cos the training takes an hour
    - Create and define an endpoint
        - Navigate to model page > Deploy and test
        - Click: Deploy to endpoint
        - Endpoint name: LoanRisk
        - Click: Continue
    - Model settings and monitoring
        - Traffic splitting settings: Unchanged
        - Machine type: n1-standard-8, 8 vCPUs, 30 GiB memory
        - All other settings: Unchanged
        - Click: Deploy

- Task 5: Shared Machine Learning (SML) Bearer Token
    - This is to get a token to use the ML model for prediction
    - Prepare Task 6 before doing the below:
        - Log in to https://gsp-auth-kjyo252taq-uc.a.run.app/
        - Copy token to clipboard
            - Token is available for about 60secs.

- Task 6: Get predictions
    - Setup environment variables needed:
    - AUTH_TOKEN: To access the endpoint
    - ENDPOINT: The ML predict endpoint
    - INPUT_DATA_FILE: Input file containing features as JSON

```
# Download files used
gsutil cp gs://spls/cbl455/cbl455.tar.gz .
tar -xvf cbl455.tar.gz

# Setup environment variables:
AUTH_TOKEN="INSERT_SML_BEARER_TOKEN"

### Confusion Matrix, Recall and Precision
__

- Confusion Matrix defines the following:
    - True Positive   TP   Predicted üêà Cat / Turned out to be üêà Cat   ‚úîÔ∏è
    - True Negative   TN   Predicted üêï Dog / Turned out to be üêï Dog   ‚úîÔ∏è
    - False Positive  FP   Predicted üêà Cat / Turned out to be üêï Dog   ‚ùå
    - False Negative  FP   Predicted üêï Dog / Turned out to be üêà Cat   ‚ùå

- Helps to think of the confusion matrix as follows:
    - Predictions come first, the actual values come later and compared
      to prediction
    - We are typically interested in Positive predictions
    - Hence the Recall and Precision are useful metrics
    - Negative predictions can easily be turned into positive
      predictions

- Recall almost 1     ‚áí  Very few false negatives
    - Missed some which were actually positive, hence imperfect recall
    - Like having to recall a list of 16 items, and of the 16 items
      remembered, some were not in the original list. Imperfect recall.
    - TP / (TP + FN)
    - Question: Did you get all of them right?

- Precision almost 1  ‚áí  Very few false positives
    - Lots of positive predictions but some turned out to be false
    - Like shooting at real and fake ducks, some ducks turned out to be
      fake, hence imperfect precision
    - TP / (TP + FP)
    - Of all the ones you shot, how many were what you aimed for?

### Feature Store
__

- The Feature Store in Vertex AI has the result of making features
  [first class
  objects](https://www.cs.iusb.edu/~danav/teach/c311/c311_2_firstclass.html)
  in AI. This is just fancy speak for making features the priority.
- And making it a priority means make it easy to work with, to organize,
  to store, to aggregate, to share, to reuse, etc.
- This leads to the interesting question:
    - What are the priority objects in different stages of the Data
      Engineering workflow?

- Task 1. Explore ecommerce data
    - Data is already in BigQuery
    - Ask: Out of the total visitors who visited our website, what % made a purchase?

```
-- 1. What % of visitors made a purchase?

#standardSQL
WITH visitors AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_visitors
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
),
purchasers AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_purchasers
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
WHERE totals.transactions IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
  total_visitors,
  total_purchasers,
  total_purchasers / total_visitors AS conversion_rate
FROM visitors, purchasers


-- 2. What are the top 5 selling products?
SELECT
  p.v2ProductName,
  p.v2ProductCategory,
  SUM(p.productQuantity) AS units_sold,
  ROUND(SUM(p.localProductRevenue/1000000),2) AS revenue
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
UNNEST(hits) AS h,
UNNEST(h.product) AS p
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 3. How many visitors bought on subsequent visits to the website?
# visitors who bought on a return visit (could have bought on first as well
WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid, # 741,721 unique visitors
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullvisitorid) AS total_visitors,
  will_buy_on_return_visit
FROM all_visitor_stats
GROUP BY will_buy_on_return_visit
```

- Task 2. Select features and create your training dataset

```
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM
  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1)
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
ORDER BY time_on_site DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

- Task 3. Create a BigQuery dataset to store models
    - Need a dataset to store models
    - Dataset ID: ecommerce

- Task 4. Select a BigQuery ML model type and specify options
    - Create a logistic regression model
    - Notice the WHERE clause that splits data into training and evaluation
    - Training takes 5-10 minutes

```
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model`
OPTIONS
(
model_type='logistic_reg',
labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']
)
AS
#standardSQL
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM
  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') # train on first 9 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,

  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
;
```

- Task 5. Evaluate classification model performance
    - Use Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) to evaluate
    - Maximize are under the curve (AUC)
    - Notice the WHERE clause now evaluates on two (2) months of data

```
SELECT
  roc_auc,
  CASE
    WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
    WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'not great'
  ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.classification_model,  (
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM
  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630') # eval on 2 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,

  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
));
```

- Task 6. Improve model performance with feature engineering
    - Add more features:
        - How far the visitor got in the checkout process on their first visit
        - Where visitors came from (traffic source: organic search, referring site etc.)
        - Device category (mobile, tablet, desktop)
        - Geographic information (country)
    - UNNEST() function
        - To break apart ARRAYS into separate rows. Making the table in 1NF (First Normal Form)

### Lab: [Set Up Network and HTTP Load Balancers](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/12007?parent=catalog)
__

Sat, 19 Mar 2022

- Tasks:
    - Task 1: Set the default region and zone for all resources
    - Task 2: Create multiple web server instances
    - Task 3: Configure the load balancing service
    - Task 4: Sending traffic to your instances
    - Task 5: Create an HTTP load balancer
    - Task 6: Testing traffic sent to your instances

- Notes:
    - The gcloud create instance is quite powerful, allowing arbitrary
      startup scripts e.g. installing apache and customizing the default
      home page
    - `gcloud compute ... create` commands:
        - addresses: Static, public IP address
        - http-health-checks: Health check resource (Legacy)
        - target-pools: Targets for IP Forwarding
        - forwarding-rules: IP Forwarding rule
        - firewall rules: Firewall rule
        - instance-templates: Templates for instances
        - instance-groups managed: Managed instance groups
        - health-checks: Health check resource
        - backend-services: A grouping of instances like target pools
        - url-maps: URL rules to map requests to backend services. This
          is a load balancer!
        - target-http-proxies: HTTP proxy to route requests to url map
    - The step in Task 3 differs from Task 5:
        - Task 3: Load balancing results from using a combination of
          forwarding rules and target pool
        - Task 5: Load balancing results from grouping the instances in
          a `backend service`
        - The target-pool + forwarding-rule in Task 3 maps to
          backend-service + url-map + target-http-proxy in Task 5. One
          more level of indirection
    - Task 5 takes awhile to come up to wait a bit before clicking on
      the `Check my progress` button
    - [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/1ZW59HrRUzw)

- Task 1: Set the default region and zone for all resources
    ```
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a
    gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
    ```

- Task 2: Create multiple web server instances
    - The `tags` attribute is used to group resources
    - Below, the `network-lb-tag` is common to all three instances
    ```
    # Create web server "www1"
    gcloud compute instances create www1 \
      --image-family debian-9 \
      --image-project debian-cloud \
      --zone us-central1-a \
      --tags network-lb-tag \
      --metadata startup-script="#! /bin/bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
        sudo service apache2 restart
        echo '<!doctype html><html><body><h1>www1</h1></body></html>' | tee /var/www/html/index.html"

    # Create web server "www2"
    gcloud compute instances create www2 \
      --image-family debian-9 \

    curl http://34.67.240.70
    curl http://35.184.186.55
    ```

- Task 3: Configure the load balancing service
    ```
    # Create a static, public IP for load balancer
    gcloud compute addresses create network-lb-ip-1 \
        --region us-central1

    # Create a legacy HTTP health check resource
    gcloud compute http-health-checks create basic-check

    # Create an empty target pool in the same region and use the
    #   health-check above.
    gcloud compute target-pools create www-pool \
        --region us-central1 --http-health-check basic-check

    # Add compute instances to the pool
    gcloud compute target-pools add-instances www-pool \
        --instances www1,www2,www3

    # Add a forwarding rule. Forwarding requests to the static, public
    # IP to the target pool containing the three web server instances

        --ports 80 \
        --address network-lb-ip-1 \
        --target-pool www-pool
    ```

- Task 4: Sending traffic to your instances
    ```
    # View the forwarding rule
    gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe www-rule --region us-central1

    # Access the external IP address continuously
    while true; do curl -m1 34.68.108.146; done

### Lab: [Kubernetes Engine: Qwik Start](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/878?parent=catalog)
__

Sat, 19 Mar 2022

- Tasks
    - Task 1: Set a default compute zone
    - Task 2: Create a GKE cluster
    - Task 3: Get authentication credentials for the cluster

- Notes:
    - Creating and deleting the cluster takes awhile so best to read
      through the lab in its entirety before starting the lab
    - [`Manage Containerized Apps with Kubernetes Engine`](https://youtu.be/u9nsngvmMK4)

- Task 1: Set a default compute zone
    ```
    # Set default zone
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a
    ```

- Task 2: Create a GKE cluster
    - A cluster has a cluster master and several workers called nodes
    - Note: Cluster names must start with a letter and end with an
      alphanumeric, and cannot be longer than 40 characters.
    ```
    # Create a cluster
    # gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER-NAME]
    gcloud container clusters create my-cluster
    ```

- Task 3: Get authentication credentials for the cluster
    - Auth credentials needed to interact with cluster
    ```
    # Get cluster credentials
    # gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER-NAME]
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster
    ```

- Task 4: Deploy an application to the cluster
    - Lab deploys a hello-app
    - `Deployment` objects are for stateless applications like web servers
    - `Service` objects define rules and load balancing for accessing
      app from the net
    ```
    # Create a new Deployment of 'hello-server' from a pre-defined container image
    kubectl create deployment hello-server --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
    # Expect: deployment.apps/hello-server created

    # Create a Service, which exposes app to external traffic
    kubectl expose deployment hello-server --type=LoadBalancer --port 8080
    # Expect: service/hello-server exposed

    # Inspect service:
    kubectl get service
    # Expect: NAME  TYPE    CLUSTER-IP  EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)    AGE
    ```

- Task 5: Deleting the cluster
    ```
    # gcloud container clusters delete [CLUSTER-NAME]
    gcloud container clusters delete my-cluster

### Lab: [Create a Virtual Machine](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/3563?parent=catalog)
__

Sat, 19 Mar 2022

- Tasks
    - Create a virtual machine with the Cloud Console.
    - Create a virtual machine with the gcloud command line.
    - Deploy a web server and connect it to a virtual machine.

- `gcloud`:
    ```
    # List active account name
    gcloud auth list

    # List project ID
    gcloud config list project
    ```

- Typical VM parameters:
    - <img src="img/notes-typical-vm-parameters.png" alt="" width="80%"/>

- Install NGINX web server on a fresh VM
    ```
    sudo su -
    apt-get update
    apt-get install nginx -y

    # Check that nginx is running
    ps auwx | grep nginx
    ```

- Create a VM via cloud shell:
    ```
    gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone us-central1-f

    # Get help on CLI
    gcloud compute instances create --help

    # Set default zone and region
    gcloud config set compute/zone ...
    gcloud config set compute/region ...

    # SSH connect
    gcloud compute ssh gcelab2 --zone us-central1-f
    ```
..


----
### Lab: [Getting Started with Cloud Shell and gcloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/563?parent=catalog)
__

Sat, 19 Mar 2022

- Task 1: Configure your environment
    ```
    # See default region and zone
    gcloud config get-value compute/zone
    gcloud config get-value compute/region

    # Describe project
    # gcloud compute project-info describe --project <your_project_ID>
    gcloud compute project-info describe --project qwiklabs-gcp-02-b02d242a3d87

    # Set environment variables:
    # export PROJECT_ID=<your_project_ID>
    export PROJECT_ID=qwiklabs-gcp-02-b02d242a3d87

    # export ZONE=<your_zone>
    export ZONE=us-central1-a

    # Create a VM
    gcloud compute instances create gcelab2 --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone $ZONE

    - gcloud compute allows you to manage your Compute Engine resources in a format that's simpler than the Compute Engine API.
    - instances create creates a new instance.
    - gcelab2 is the name of the VM.
    - The --machine-type flag specifies the machine type as n1-standard-2.
    - The --zone flag specifies where the VM is created.

    If you omit the --zone flag, the gcloud tool can infer your desired zone based on your default properties. Other required instance settings, such as machine type and image, are set to default values if not specified in the create command.

    # To get help
    gcloud compute instances create --help

    # gcloud help
    gcloud -h
    gcloud config --help

    # List gcloud config
    gcloud config list                  # common user config
    gcloud config list --all            # all config

    # List gcloud components
    gcloud components list
    ```

- Task 2: Install a new component
    ```
    # Install beta components:
    sudo apt-get install google-cloud-sdk

    # Enable gcloud interactive mode:
    gcloud beta interactive

    ```

- Task 3: Connect to VM via SSH
    ```
    gcloud compute ssh gcelab2 --zone $ZONE

    ```

### Apache Beam and Google DataFlow
__

- How are they related?

- Apache Beam is the program, DataFlow is the engine

- If they were database technologies, Apache Beam would be SQL programs
  and DataFlow would be the database engine running those SQL programs

- There other pipeline runners other than Google DataFlow. But the key
  feature of DataFlow is autoscaling

- See also: https://medium.com/swlh/dataflow-and-apache-beam-the-result-of-a-learning-process-since-mapreduce-c591b2ab180e (TODO)

    ```
    List active account names
        gcloud auth list

    List project ID
        gcloud config list project
    ```

- Regions and zones
    - One region has many zones
    - Naming convention: REGION-ZONE
        - Region: us-west1, Zone: a  -->  us-west1-a
        - Region: us-west1, Zone: b  -->  us-west1-b
        - Region: asia-east1, Zone: a  -->  asia-east1-a
        - etc
    - Zones are like data centers (I think)
    - Resources such as VM, Storage, etc live in zones aka data centers
