# Work Log

A chronological log of the things I'm doing to get to my goal of
becoming a Cloud Data Engineer.

**Fri, 18 Mar 2022**

- Continued auditing Week 1 of the [`Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals`](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-big-data-ml-fundamentals) course on Coursera.
- Enrolled in the course yesterday.

**Some Background**

- Actually I first enrolled in the [`Enterprise Database Migration`](https://www.coursera.org/learn/enterprise-database-migration) course but the pre-requisite for that is this BDML Fundamentals course.
- Prior to that I was planning to complete the [`IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate`](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-engineer). However, after auditing about four (4) out of a total of thirteen (13) courses, I found some of the labs rather slow-going and cumbersome. The scope is also very much traditional Data Warehousing. I think the opportunities are in Cloud Data Warehousing with notions of autoscaling and data lakes and machine learning.
- I find the BDML Fundamentals course is more interesting, broadening the scope of what is possible. I might still go back to do some of the IBM courses but perhaps later.
