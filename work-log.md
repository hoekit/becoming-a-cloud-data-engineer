# Work Log
<small>A chronological log of the things I'm doing to get to my goal of becoming a Cloud Data Engineer.</small>

- Finished the [`Google Cloud Essentials`](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/70c3e8fe-77a0-45d9-a627-fa64f50ddafa) course.
    - A fairly good intro to the Cloud Console and the very
      comprehensive `gcloud` CLI
    - I find that Google Cloud is more geared toward CLI usage, with the
      UI a bit unwieldy and this is actually quite fine. Azure portal on
      the other hand is more GUI centric probably which is also okay, I
      suppose but CLI is better for repeatability and scripting.

- Continued working on the Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals course
    - Finished the *Big Data with BigQuery* module. The third of five modules.
    - The [BigQuery demo](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_sessions/887252/video/198822) was nicely done and the [BigQuery ML Lab](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_sessions/887252/labs/198828) was very eye-opening (at least to me).
    - Start *Machine Learning Options on Google Cloud*. The fourth of five modules.
    - Completed *Machine Learning Options on Google Cloud*.
        - No lab in this module.
        - Mostly marketing materials covering the various ML/AI options
          and solutions that Google offers

- Continued auditing Week 1 of the [`Google Cloud Big Data and Machine
  Learning Fundamentals`](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-big-data-ml-fundamentals)
  course on Coursera.
- Enrolled in the course yesterday.
- Decided to enroll in the [`BigQuery Basics for Data Analysts
  Quest`](https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/69). A completion badge would
  some hands-on familiarity with BigQuery.
- Subscribed to the [`Data Engineer Learning Path`](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/16)

**Some Background**

- Actually I first enrolled in the [`Enterprise Database
  Migration`](https://www.coursera.org/learn/enterprise-database-migration)
  course but the pre-requisite for that is this BDML Fundamentals
  course.

- Prior to that I was planning to complete the [`IBM Data Engineering
  Professional
  Certificate`](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-engineer).
  Started auditing the first course back, about two weeks ago, on 03 Mar
  2022. However, after auditing close to four (4) out of a total of
  thirteen (13) courses, I found some of the labs rather slow-going and
  cumbersome. The scope is also very much traditional Data Warehousing.
  I think the opportunities these days are in Cloud Data Analytics with
  notions of data-lakes, auto-scaling and machine learning.

- I find the BDML Fundamentals course is more interesting, broadening
  the scope of what is possible. The customer use-cases were definitely
  very motivating. I might still go back to do some of the IBM courses
  but perhaps later.
