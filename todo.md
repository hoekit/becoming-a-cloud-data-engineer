# TODO
<small>Things to do that'll enhance the Cloud Data Engineering journey</small>

----

- Would be nice to compare the features of Dataflow/Apache Beam and how
  the equivalent is achieved in Apache Spark or other solutions
    - Or maybe do a proper search on the web and collect in one place,
      everything related to them and write up an article

- Study the flow in this Apache Beam analytics project:
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPuE30kY6-c
    - Design and create a platform that can handle auto-production and
      broadcasting, for up to hundreds of games per weekend with as
      little time delay as possible

- Create a Data Quality Cheatsheet
    - Start by collecting the tips in DQ in BigQuery. [web](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_sessions/905155/video/115842)
    - Extend as needed.
